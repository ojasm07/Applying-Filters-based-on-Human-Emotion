Computer Vision, Deep Learning
The project is completed. Copyright work in progress. The files will be uploaded soon. 


Trained a deep learning model, i.e CNN which had 3 convolution and fully connected layers, for real-time emotion recognition in PyTorch.
Developed a model that performed face detection using OpenCV. Built multiple filters to apply to the detected face based on the emotions.
