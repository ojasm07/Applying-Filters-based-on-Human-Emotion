# Applying-Filters-based-on-Human-Emotion
Computer Vision, Deep Learning \\

The project is completed. Copyright work in progress. The files will be uploaded soon. 



Developed a model that performed face detection using OpenCV in real-time. \\

Trained a deep learning model, i.e CNN which had 3 convolution and fully connected layers, in PyTorch, which could detect emotions\\

The model has an accuracy of 89%. \\

Built multiple filters to apply to the detected face based on the detected emotions.\\
